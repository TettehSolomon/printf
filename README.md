# 0x11. C - printf

---

## Description

---

This team project is part of the first Project from ALX Africa. it is intended to make us work and understand the printf() function using C Library.


What we're expected to learn include.

* Group Projects  and collaboration in git

* Flowcharts

* Technical writing

---

## Prototype
```
int _printf(const char *format, ...);
```

## Usage

---

* Prints a string to the standard output, according to a given format

* All files were created and compiled on Ubuntu 14.04.4 LTS using GCC 4.8.4 wuth the command `` gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c ````

* Returns the number of characters in the Output string on success, -1 otherwise

* Call it this way: ``` _printf("format string", arguments...) ``` where ``` format string ``` can contain conversion specifiers and flags, along with regular charachters.


## Examples

---

* ``` _printf("Hello, Alx\n")``` *prints* *"Hello, Holberton", followed by a new line*

* ``` _printf("%s", "Hello") ``` *prints "Hello"*

* ``` _printf("This is a number: %d", 98) ``` *prints "This is a number: 98"*

# Tasks

---

These are all the tasks of this project, the ones that are completed link to thecorresponding files.

### [0. I'm not going anywhere. You can print that wherever you want to. I'm here and I'm a Spur for life(https://#)]
 Write a function that produces output according to format.
    * Prototype: ``` int _printf(const char *format, ...)```;
    * Returns: the number of characters printed (excluding the null byte used to end output to strings)
    * write output to stdout, the standard output stream
    * format is a character string. The format string is composed of zero or more directives. See man 3 printf for more detail. You need to handle the following conversion specifiers:
        * c
        * s
        * %

### [1. Education is when you read the fine print. Experience is what you get if you don't(https://#)]

    * Handle the following conversion specifiers:

        * d: converts input into a base 10 integer.

        * i: converts input into an integer.
### [2. Just because it's in print doesn't mean it's the gospel(https://#)]
        * Create a man page for your function.
